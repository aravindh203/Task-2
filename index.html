	 <h1><mark>SUPER MARKET</mark>:</h1>
		 <p >A <b>supermarket</b> is a self-service shop offering a wide variety of food, beverages and household products, organized into sections. This kind of store is larger and has a wider selection than earlier grocery stores, but is smaller and more limited in the range of merchandise than a hypermarket or big-box market. In everyday U.S. usage, however, <mark>"grocery store"</mark> is synonymous with supermarket,[1] and is not used to refer to other types of stores that sell groceries.</p>
		 <p>The <b>supermarket</b> typically has places for fresh meat, fresh produce, dairy, deli items, baked goods, etc. Shelf space is also reserved for canned and <u>packaged goods and for various non-food items</u> such as kitchenware, household cleaners, pharmacy products and pet supplies. Some supermarkets also sell other household products that are consumed regularly, such as alcohol (where permitted), medicine, and clothing, and some sell a much wider range of non-food products: <mark>DVDs, sporting equipment, board games, and seasonal items</mark>.</p>
		 <p>Supermarkets typically are chain stores, supplied by the distribution centers of their parent companies, thus <mark>increasing opportunities for economies of scale</mark>. Supermarkets usually offer products at <u>relatively low prices</u> by using their buying power to buy goods from <strike>manufacturers</strike> at lower prices than smaller stores can. They also minimise financing costs by paying for goods at least 30 days after receipt and some extract credit terms of 90 days or more from vendors. Certain products (typically staple foods such as bread, milk and sugar) are very occasionally sold as loss leaders so as to attract shoppers to their store. Supermarkets make up for their low margins by a high volume of sales, and with of <mark>higher-margin items bought by the attracted shoppers</mark>. Self-service with shopping carts (trolleys) or baskets reduces labor costs, and many supermarket chains are attempting further reduction by shifting to <b>self-service</b> check-out</p>
